### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have different hobbies, but last times my passion is programming development.
I use Java and Kotlin languages to create new applications.
It could be based on different platforms: on back-end side with Sprong Boot or native Android.

### Get in touch
    I like to write technical articles in blog, it allows to understand task and problems more deeply.
